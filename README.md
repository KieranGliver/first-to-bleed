# FirstToBleed - Game Design Document

**Genre:** Asynchronous Tile-painting Roguelike Deckbuilder  
**Overview:**  
Players face off in competitive, real-time rounds by deploying units ("Plebs") and buildings to control territory on a shared grid. Victory comes through strategic placement, deck optimization, and area control.

---

## Strategic Principles

- As players claim more territory, maintaining control becomes more difficult as Plebs bounce less frequently off strategically placed buildings and resources become spread thin.
- Balancing offense, defense, and resource generation is key to long-term success.
- Archetypes are designed to counter and outmaneuver each other, encouraging dynamic matchup
