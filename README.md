# FirstToBleed - Game Design Document

**Genre:** Asynchronous Tile-painting Roguelike Deckbuilder  
**Overview:**  
Players face off in competitive, real-time rounds by deploying units ("Plebs") and buildings to control territory on a shared grid. Victory comes through strategic placement, deck optimization, and area control.

---

## Strategic Principles

- As players claim more territory, maintaining control becomes more difficult as Plebs bounce less frequently off strategically placed buildings and resources become spread thin.
- Balancing offense, defense, and resource generation is key to long-term success.
- Archetypes are designed to counter and outmaneuver each other, encouraging dynamic matchup

---

## Core Mechanics

### Plebs

- Plebs can't die. When a pleb is on a square that is being switched they fly back to their hq
- Pleb count can be increased by buildings that will instantly spawn plebs. If destroied they 
- Each colour in battle will have a max limit to plebs that can be increased by buildings
- Move in straight lines until:
  - Hitting a building = bounce and attack.
  - Hitting unclaimed area = bounce, gain ducats and claim.
  - Hitting a claimed territory = bouce and declaim.
  - Hitting a terrain = bounce.
- **Bounce Behavior:**
  - Redirects Pleb in a non-blocked direction.
  - Slight randomness to increase excitement
  - Some Plebs have bounce direction preferences?

---

## Buildings

Buildings come in Common, Rare, and Legendary tiers, affecting cost and power.

### Placement

### Health

- All buildings have base HP.
- When a pleb hits the building it will take one damage.
- Destroyed buildings leave behind Ruins tiles, which some archetypes (e.g. Scrap) can exploit?

### Activation Types
