# FirstToBleed - Game Design Document

**Genre:** Asynchronous Tile-painting Roguelike Deckbuilder  
**Overview:**  
Players face off in competitive, real-time rounds by deploying units ("Plebs") and buildings to control territory on a shared grid. Victory comes through strategic placement, deck optimization, and area control.

---

## Strategic Principles

- As players claim more territory, maintaining control becomes more difficult as Plebs bounce less frequently off strategically placed buildings and resources become spread thin.
- Balancing offense, defense, and resource generation is key to long-term success.
- Archetypes are designed to counter and outmaneuver each other, encouraging dynamic matchup

## Asynchronous multiplayer

During battles the player will face three computer opponents controlling other users decks. These decks will be real decks made by other players on their runs

### Uploading your deck

The decks are saved in a sql database that contains two tables:

#### sessions

| id (uuid) | day (int) | created_at (timestamp) |
|-----------|-----------|------------------------|

#### decks

| deck_id (uuid) | building_id (int) | amount (int) |
|----------------|-------------------|--------------|

- The primary key for sessions is id
- The primary key for decks is deck_id, building_id
- deck_id is a foreign key for id in sessions

Before battle (After the store) the players deck is uploaded to the database

### Loading your decks

At the beginning of the battle the gamemanager will load three random decks from the day after to each opponent. The decks will be one day advanced as the ai cheats always.
If the player isnt connected to the internet base decks will need to be manually stored in the game to load on each day.
